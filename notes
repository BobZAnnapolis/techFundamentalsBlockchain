blockchain [bc]
BC Networks : HyperLedger, Definity, Ethereum, BitCoin

Ethereum networks

Goals :
- understand the essential technical aspects
- install an ethereum wallet
- send a test transaction

blockchain : decentralized database that stores a registry {ledger} of transactions across a peer-to-peer network.

4 attributes :
- permissionless
- transparent
- immutable
- secure

Ethereuem
- built after bitcoin
- provides a network for developers to build apps on top of the network
- apps usually comprised of ‘smarts contracts’ that contain instructions and require ‘ether’ to run on the network
- each person that is part of the network provides the network with ‘computing power’ for other member

core infrastructure {tcp/ip}
middleware
apps on top of middleware {“dapps” - decentralized apps}


BLOCKCHAIN WALLETS
=================

- provide access for individual users to transact on a blockchain network
- essentially, wallet = account
- wallets provide access to the other users and ’dapps’ on the network
- when you install personal wallet onto a blockchain network - too get access to just that bc network
- an interface to engage to a broader network


how does it work technically ?

- course uses ethereum wallets
- a wallet sit on top of bc networks allow for exchange and transactions using ‘ether’

‘ether’ : 
dual purpose :
  - used as the powering resource for the apps built on top of the Ethereum Network
  - base currency for exchange between network participants and what ‘dapps’ spend

wallets are the terminal thru which participants gain access to the underlying network
as new wallets are added, it potentially adds a new “miner” to the network 
every additional miner adds incremental resources 

ethereum network runs on collective computing power called ether


Why are bc wallets important ?

- essential to participation
- each chain has its own version
- each wallet provides access to just that network
- each wallet provides access to the dapps built on top of the network
- wallet assigns you an immutable account-based identity thru which you interact w/dapps and their uses


BLOCKCHAIN TOKENS
=================

sub-currencies on the bc which allow for tracking value in the form of credit or asset as they pass thru a particular bc network
functionally similar to coins, e.g. USD cashed in for so many Chucky Cheese tokens which can only be used at Chucky Cheese

How do bc tokens work ?

a blockchains is a large world virtual computer
tokens are a resource that manage the computing power of this computer

tokens are a ‘smart-contract’ of a different format

can be classified to different roles, predominantly :
- value-usage tokens
- work tokens

value-usage tokens
- behave similarly to the standard currency for the respective dapps, they essentially hold a relative price tag 
- and can be separated from the value of ether

work tokens
- function to provide privileges to app participants {comparable to shareholder’s rights}
- e.g., voting rights, automated business logic


Why are blockchain tokens important ?

- enable blockchain networks to be connected to assets
- w/o tokens, blockchain networks would just exist as secure decentralized databases
- tokens allow for assets on top of the network to hold value
  - such that we can leverage the bc protocol
- these tokens are fundamental in unlocking the value ADD advantages of asset mgmt on a bc


ETHEREUM WALLETS
================

-installing an ethereal wallet into a web browser

- connect to the Ropsten Ethereum Test Network
- does not have value
- all ether and transaction are for test purposes only

- to enable the browser to handle wallets, install plugin
  - go to metamask.io
    - landing page will have a link for your browser or something called “Brave”
      - Brave is a browser already set up for handling a bc network, wallets and browsing ethereal network dapps
    - click the link to install the plug-in for your browser
      - click the “Add to FireFox” button
      - on the popup - accept all the bulleted items - click Add
  - after it’s added, will appears as a small fox icon at top of browser
    - will be brought to a home landing page w/video to demonstrate how this works
    - click on the icon to read the Privacy Notice
    - read & accept the terms of use
    - you’ll then be prompted to enter in a password to use while on the bc network  {password}
    - save the words presented in order to restore your account, should you need to
erase provide midnight tissue ivory skull minor random confirm alarm law end

    - password is used to create my “vault” in MetaMask
    
    - this now has installed an Ethereal wallet/vault in FireFox
    - click on the different dapps to see how quickly & easily you can get to, and interact with, them via your own wallet


Sending a Test Transaction
==========================
- click on the account icon, change the name, look at the options
- for this test, we need 2 accounts
  - send ether
  - receive ether
  - create another account
    - click on the circular icon and give it a name
  - accounts get created by default on the Main Ethereal Network
    - switch to the Ropsten Test Network so we can “play” around
    - need tokens - click on “Buy” and select the “Test Faucet”
    - this “faucet” will feed you N Ethereum tokens at a time to allow you to test out apps and the network - no real ether value
      - opens up a web page to the text ether faucet 
        - click button to request 1 ether
        - a transaction appears at the bottom
        - click on it to seethe details
        - details get displayed on Etherscan
          - website showing all transactions on the network
          - will display which network the action is for at the top of the page
          - details indicate how long it takes to get a confirmation
          - once the action is completed / confirmed - return to your account and see the ether
          - send 1/2 to the other account
          - the values appearing in the pop-up are what it costs to perform the action
            - including how much we contribute to the network in order to perform/validate/execute the action
              - the lowest network prices for gas will be used


Interacting With DAPPS
======================

- decentralized apps that run in the browser and execute ’smart contracts’ on the Ethereum network
  - stateofthedapps.com for a list of DAPPs
    - color-coded
    - stealth projects, abandoned, demo, etc

    - look at the demo apps
      - simple vote
        - interacting w/dapps requires us to “pay the gas”

NOTE : YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY THESE GAS FEES FOR EVERY TRANSACTION YOU WISH TO SEND ON THE MAIN ETHEREUM NETWORK
