blockchain [bc]
BC Networks : HyperLedger, Definity, Ethereum, BitCoin

Ethereum networks

Goals :
- understand the essential technical aspects
- install an ethereum wallet
- send a test transaction

blockchain : decentralized database that stores a registry {ledger} of transactions across a peer-to-peer network.

4 attributes :
- permissionless
- transparent
- immutable
- secure

Ethereuem
- built after bitcoin
- provides a network for developers to build apps on top of the network
- apps usually comprised of ‘smarts contracts’ that contain instructions and require ‘ether’ to run on the network
- each person that is part of the network provides the network with ‘computing power’ for other member

core infrastructure {tcp/ip}
middleware
apps on top of middleware {“dapps” - decentralized apps}


blockchain wallets

- provide access for individual users to transact on a blockchain network
- essentially, wallet = account
- wallets provide access to the other users and ’dapps’ on the network
- when you install personal wallet onto a blockchain network - too get access to just that bc network
- an interface to engage to a broader network


how does it work technically ?

- course uses ethereum wallets
- a wallet sit on top of bc networks allow for exchange and transactions using ‘ether’

‘ether’ : 
dual purpose :
  - used as the powering resource for the apps built on top of the Ethereum Network
  - base currency for exchange between network participants and what ‘dapps’ spend

wallets are the terminal thru which participants gain access to the underlying network
as new wallets are added, it potentially adds a new “miner” to the network 
every additional miner adds incremental resources 

ethereum network runs on collective computing power called ether


Why are bc wallets important ?
